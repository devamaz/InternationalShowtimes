# International Showtime

### installation

`yarn`

Familiarizing with `crawl-e` but facing some issue so I had switch to `cheerio` because of time. I am getting familiar with Crawl-e, on `netflix-crawler.js` it's a matter of time before I master how it works properly. 
### start netflix crawling

```bash
$ node netflixCrawl.js
```

### start pantaflix crawling

```bash
$ node pantaflix-crawler.js
```
